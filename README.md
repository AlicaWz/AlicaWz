I am a 28-year-old Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer based in Hamburg, passionate about creating, learning, and embracing variety. My journey into development began in 2020 during the pandemic, when I discovered a love for coding through a three-week online course. This sparked my transition from design to development, motivated by a need for variety and continuous learning.
